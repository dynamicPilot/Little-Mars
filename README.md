# Little Mars
 Liitle Mars: puzzle game with resource management and Mars

## Intro

One day I was playing a board game with polyominoes and thought... hmm... and why not do something similar in a mobile game?! And so the idea of Little Mars was born…
This is my first mobile game project and I really want as many people as possible to try it. Any comments or feedback are welcome!

## About
Little Mars is a Mars’ colony building puzzle game with multiple short levels that combines resource management, building placement mechanics and simulation elements.

## Features

### Solving puzzles
Consistently move from level to level, each of which is a small puzzle with its own goals and conditions. In the game, all levels are immediately available to you - from easiest to the most difficult, so, if you want, feel free to choose.

### Building
Build your own tiny colony on the surface of the mysterious Mars. Construct buildings observing the rules for their placement and taking into account the terrain features. Build solar power plants, supply units and farms to ensure a comfortable life in domes. Develop deposits, extract rare metals, produce machines and goods. Use rockets to send unique products from the Red Planet to Earth.

### Resource management
Manage the resources competently, maintaining a balance of consumption and production, not forgetting to stock up and fulfill goals. Ensure an uninterrupted supply of the domes with everything your colonists need to be satisfied. Develop deposits to have access to the metals, produce machines, build factories and workshops. Plan the construction of new buildings carefully, as the supply of resources is almost always limited.

### Manufacturing control
Set the operating mode of buildings depending on the time of the Martian day, the needs of the colony and the level goals. Turn on factories and cosmodrome during the day when the sun is shining in the Martian sky, and conserve electricity at night by suspending production. Determine the operating modes and the buildings themselves will follow the established schedule.

### Cute pixel graphics
Atmospheric pixel graphics that fit well into the concept of the game.
